1) two types of datasets are supported
   - ibm format (cid tid #items itemset)
	Here each line contains the 
	   customerid, transid, number of items, and list of items

   - basic ascii format (itemset) 
        Here each line is just a list of items

  only integer datasets are supported

  two example test databases are included in the dir
  	testdb_ibm.ascii (in ibm format)
	testdb.ascii (non-ibm format)

2) type charm to see the list of options supported

  a basic run of charm is as follows:
	charm -i <DB> -o <PAT_OUT> -s <MINSUP> -r <MINCONF> 
	
	this will mine the database file <DB>
	it will output the closed freq patterns to file <PAT_OUT>
	it will use MINSUP as the relative minsup (e.g. 0.5 is 50%)
	it will use MINCONF as the minimum conf for the rules
	both MINSUP and MINCONF must be between 0 and 1.
	the rules are printed to stdout if -R flag is given.
	
        EXAMPLE: charm -i testdb_ibm.ascii -o patout -s 0.5 -r 0.75 -R

	some example rules are:
	100% 2  ==> 1  ( 4 1 )
	explanation: this is a 100% conf rule, the rule is 2 ==> 1,
		the rule support is 4, and the rule conf is 1 (100%)
	<100% 1  ==> 4  ( 5 0.833333 )
	explanation: this is a <100% conf rule, the rule is 1 ==> 4,
		the rule support is 5, and the rule conf is 0.83 (83.3%)

	TO RUN NON_IBM DB without offset:
	just add the -x flag (for non-ibm datasets)
	EXAMPLE: charm -x -i testdb.ascii -o patout -s 0.5 -r 0.75

	
./charm -x -i testdb.ascii -o rt -S 2 -d 0 -l

./charm -x -i testdb.ascii -o rt  -s 0.01 -d 0 -l
